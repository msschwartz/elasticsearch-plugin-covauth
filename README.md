Covisint Authorization Elasticsearch Plugin
===========================================
This is just a draft version.

==== Testing ====
The _package-and-start-server.sh_ script can be used to package the plugin and fire up an 
elasticsearch cluster with this plugin installed. Before running the script, download v1.5.2 and 
extract contents into a directory named _elasticsearch_ at the root of this project.
